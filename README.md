# American Election Data -- Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and final report for a 2-week long group project by Axel Amzallag and Kevin Sun as part of COMPSCI 289A (Introduction to Machine Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley. The goal of the project was to predict voter behavior in the 2016 election based on voters' views in various question categories. The voter data used was publicly available from the American National Election Survey's 2016 Time Series data (https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2016-time-series-study/).

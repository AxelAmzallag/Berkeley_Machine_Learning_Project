# American Election Data -- Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and final report for a 2-week long group project by Axel Amzallag and Kevin Sun as part of COMPSCI 289A (Introduction to Machine Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley. The goal of the project was to predict voter behavior in the 2016 election based on voters' views in various question categories. The voter data used was publicly available from the American National Election Survey's 2016 Time Series Study (https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2016-time-series-study/).

### Quick Reference -- Start Here

The best way to read about the project's process and findings in an organized fashion is the **Final_Report.pdf** file (https://github.com/AxelAmzallag/Berkeley_Machine_Learning_Project/blob/main/Final_Report.pdf) in the main branch. The main analysis and conclusions are all described in some detail in this file, which is 4 pages in length. 

### Directory Reference

Starting from the Root directory of the repository:
-  **Code**: Contains all Python scripts that created the outputs for the final report. The plots used in the final report can be found in the Outputs sub-directory, and the lists of questions that went into each variable grouping can be found in the Variable_Groups Markdown file.
-  **Data**: Contains the raw election data, as collected by the researchers, in a variety of data formats. The Codebook sub-directory contains the codebook and user manual for the American National Election Survey Data.
-  **Final_Report.pdf**: The final report submitted by Axel Amzallag and Kevin Sun. This file contains a walk-through of the project methods, models, analysis, and conclusions.
